# Elegit
A graphics-based Git client for teaching people both how to work Git and how Git works.

### Running the source code in IntelliJ:
1. Open [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
2. Check out the repository using the "Check out from Version Control option" and paste the GitHub repository URL in.
3. It will ask you to open `pom.xml`. Choose yes.
4. Let it load.
5. It will ask at some point if you want to auto import settings from Maven; say yes.
4. In the *Project Structure* menu, under *Project*, make sure the Project SDK is *at least* Java Version 8 Update 60.
5. Run the `main` method of the `Main` class.
