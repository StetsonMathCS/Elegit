Still doesn't remember what kind of authentication you are using. I tried storing it, but the problem is that I was trying to use the pathname where stored as a key for remembering that; but there's an 80 character limit on key length, and pathnames are longer than that. Need to fix.
Perhaps go back to using PrefObj, and using a prefix to make sure it doesn't go as a path somewhere? Still seems like overkill.



Currently, when you clone a repo, handleLoadRepoMenuItem clones it (or opens up), but it just sits around until it is then later opened.At that point, an entire list of all repos strings are saved.


Test no repos at all
Test HTTPS, ssh w/ passwords in app and add tests as necessary
Add SSH public key


SSH with password is still sensitive to if you have a .ssh/config file entry for it, with no diagnostic info when it goes wrong. Need to fix.

Remember to clean up old prefs when testing. Verify that the number of prefs before and after testing is the same.
